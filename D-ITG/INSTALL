Installation notes
==================

- To enable DEBUG** mode using a specific verbosity level add "debug=<level>" to make command line
  where <level> is a positive integer value (bigger value -> more verbose)

For Linux users

	- To enable SCTP** support add "sctp=on" option to make command line (requires kernel version >= 2.5.15)

	- To enable DCCP** support add "dccp=on" option to make command line (requires kernel version >= 2.6.14-rc1)

	- Type "make" in the "src" directory

For Windows users 

	- Verify that the first line of the file "win.mk" refers to the right path of your Dev-Cpp base folder

	- Compile with Dev-Cpp command-line or using the IDE:

		Using Dev-Cpp* command-line:
	
			- Set the correct path to "make" executable:

				$ path <Dev-Cpp base dir>\bin;%PATH%	(Windows 2000/XP)

				or

				$ set PATH=<Dev-Cpp base dir>\bin;%PATH%;	(Windows 98/ME)

			- To obtain IPv6** binaries add "ipv6=on" to make command line

			- Type "make -f win.mk" in the "src" directory

		Using Dev-Cpp* IDE:
	
			- Open "src/D-ITG.dev" project

			- To obtain IPv6** binaries uncomment "CXXIPV6" line in "win.mk"

			- Type CTRL + F11 to compile


All the executables will be created in the "bin" directory.

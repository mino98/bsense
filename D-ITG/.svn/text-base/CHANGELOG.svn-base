	5.1. Reconstruction of receiver log files created by using the new log-info types (-r option).
	5.2. Printing of the inter departure time of each packet (-? option).
	5.3. Printing of the packet size of each packet (-j option).
    6. Improved version of the manual.
    7. Both an "install" and an "uninstall" options have been added to the Linux Makefile.

Bug Fixing
A massive work of stability fixes has been done.
Some of the bugs fixed are related to:
    1. the management of the log files at receiver side;
    2. parsing of multiple flows; 
    3. the decoding of log files.

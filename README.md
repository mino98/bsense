# BSense, an automated broadband census system
This is one of the tools I developed as part of my PhD at the University of Edinburgh. There isn't much documentation around, but feel free to get in touch by [email](mailto:mino@minux.it)!

Here a short abstract:
> BSense is a flexible broadband mapping system for broadband coverage and quality assessment of broadband connections in a given geographic region. For coverage related analysis, it relies on data that is either obtained from ISPs or generated based on technology
models and information about infrastructure sites. Broadband quality assessment in BSense is via host-based measurements using our multiplatform and technology-adaptive software client which periodically runs as a background process on usersâ€™ computers. The host-based software measurement approach employed in BSense is not only cost-effective but is also flexible and reduces measurement bias. BSense also incorporates a flexible broadband quality index for summarizing the collective effect of various underlying attributes such as download/upload speeds and latency.
